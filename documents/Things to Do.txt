    ===================
    Whenever a payment is voluntarily sent to someone by a sender, 
    the balance of the recieving user should be updated.

    Whenever a payment request (requesting from another person to pay you)
    is sent, it should not be added to the balance until it is accepted.

Consider adding:
- admin approval for payments over a certain dollar threshold
- applying a certain fee on payments (percentage or fixed amount)
